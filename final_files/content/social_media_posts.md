**Focus:** Professional growth, productivity, open source trust.

**Text:**
Is it easy to 10x your productivity with AI? Maybe. But what about 100x?

That’s the question we tackled in the latest Agent Factory podcast with Taylor Mullin, creator of Gemini CLI. We dove deep into why building AI tools in the open isn't just a "nice to have"—it's a security necessity.

My favorite takeaway: The "meta" moment where the CLI wrote its own markdown parser because Taylor hit a wall. It’s not just a tool; it’s a force multiplier.

Check out the full episode and my breakdown on the blog. 👇

**Focus:** The "Meta" moment, punchy, viral potential.

**Text:**
"I can write a markdown parser for you." 🤯

That’s what Gemini CLI told its creator, Taylor Mullin, when he got stuck. And then... it did.

We talked about this and the future of agentic workflows on The Agent Factory.

**Focus:** Storytelling, "behind the scenes" vibe.

**Text:**
Did you know Gemini CLI started 1.5 years ago? 🕰️

Back then, it was "too early." It took 90 seconds to get a response. Today? It’s rewriting the playbook for developer tools.

We sat down with Taylor Mullin to hear the full origin story. It’s a masterclass in timing and persistence.

**Focus:** Technical details, architecture, "Agentic Loop".

**Text:**
**Title:** How Gemini CLI "Self-Heals" and Writes Its Own Code

I just wrapped up a deep dive with Taylor Mullin on how Gemini CLI works under the hood. Two things stood out to me:

1.  **No Embeddings:** It uses "agentic search" (grep, find, reading files) just like a human developer, ensuring it has the perfect context every time.
2.  **Self-Healing:** If a command fails, it reads the error, iterates, and tries a new approach without you lifting a finger.

If you're building agents or just love CLI tools, you need to hear this.
