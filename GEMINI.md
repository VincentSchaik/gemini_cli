# Gemini CLI Course Workspace

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the working environment for the DeepLearning.AI course "Gemini CLI: Code & Create with an Open-Source Agent". It is a collection of educational resources, starter code, and reference implementations designed to teach the capabilities of the Gemini CLI agent.

The repository is structured to support sequential lessons covering various domains:
*   **Software Development:** Building a React website.
*   **Data Analysis:** Processing and visualizing conference lead data.
*   **Content Creation:** Generating blog posts and social media content.
*   **Learning:** Summarizing and querying course materials.

## Directory Structure

### `prompts/`
Contains the Markdown files for each lesson's specific instructions and prompts (e.g., `lesson_03.md`, `lesson_04.md`). These guide the interactive sessions with the Gemini agent.

### `starter_files/`
Provides the initial codebase and file structure for the exercises. Students typically start here or copy these files to a working directory to begin a lesson.

### `final_files/`
Contains the completed "reference" versions of the projects for each module. Useful for comparing solutions or debugging.
*   `website/`: The TechStack Conference React application.
*   `data-analysis/`: scripts and notebooks for lead processing.
*   `content/`: Generated marketing content and voice guides.
*   `learning/`: Educational summaries and notes.

### `materials/`
Holds raw assets used throughout the course, such as:
*   CSV files for data analysis.
*   SVG assets for design.
*   Markdown and PDF documents for content and learning tasks.

## Key Files
*   `README.md`: General course overview, setup instructions, and installation guide.
*   `GEMINI.md`: This file. It provides context to the Gemini agent about the repository's purpose and structure, ensuring better assistance during the course.

## Usage
To work on a specific lesson:
1.  Refer to the corresponding file in `prompts/` for instructions.
2.  Navigate to the relevant subdirectory (usually starting with `starter_files/` or creating a new folder).
3.  Use the Gemini CLI to execute tasks as described in the lesson plan.
